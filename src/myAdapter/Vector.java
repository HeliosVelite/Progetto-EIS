/**
 * Class Vector of Java Micro Edition CLDC1.1
 * <br>
 * <p>
 * The Vector class implements a growable array of objects.
 * Like an array, it contains components that can be accessed using an integer index. However, the size of a Vector can grow or shrink as needed to accommodate adding and removing items after the Vector has been created.
 * Each vector tries to optimize storage management by maintaining a capacity and a capacityIncrement. The capacity is always at least as large as the vector size; it is usually larger because as components are added to the vector, the vector's storage increases in chunks the size of capacityIncrement. An application can increase the capacity of a vector before inserting a large number of components; this reduces the amount of incremental reallocation.
 * </p>
 * <b>This class purpose is to force Java Micro Edition CLDC1.1 version of the Vector class into a work environment with the last version of Java</b>
 * @see <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javame/config/cldc/ref-impl/cldc1.1/jsr139/index.html">CLDC1.1</a>
